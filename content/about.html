<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  I am a PhD researcher in Plant Breeding & Genomics at the
  University of Georgia, working on genetic improvement of peanut
  (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>).
</p>

<p>
  A major component of my work involves developing drought-tolerant and
  white mold–resistant peanut lines through breeding, integrating field
  phenotyping with genomic analyses to identify and advance superior genotypes.
  I work across multiple generations and populations, linking phenotypic
  performance with underlying genomic regions.
</p>

<p>
  My research integrates pangenome and graph-based genomics with
  population-scale variant analysis to detect introgressed segments from wild
  relatives and characterize genomic regions associated with stress tolerance
  and disease resistance. I work extensively with long-read and short-read
  sequencing data, structural variation, and regional variant density profiling.
</p>

<p class="muted">
  Overall, my interests lie at the intersection of applied plant breeding,
  comparative genomics, and data visualization, with the goal of translating
  genomic insights into practical tools and strategies for peanut improvement.
