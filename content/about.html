  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    I am a PhD researcher in <b>Plant Breeding & Genomics</b> at the
    <b>University of Georgia</b>, working on genetic improvement of peanut
    (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) with a focus on drought tolerance, white mold resistance,
    and utilization of wild introgression for crop improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    A major component of my work involves <b>developing drought-tolerant and
    white mold–resistant peanut lines through breeding</b>, integrating field
    phenotyping with genomic analyses to identify and advance superior genotypes.
    I work across multiple generations and populations, linking phenotypic
    performance with underlying genomic regions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research integrates <b>pangenome and graph-based genomics</b> with
    population-scale variant analysis to detect introgressed segments from wild
    relatives and characterize genomic regions associated with stress tolerance
    and disease resistance. I work extensively with long-read and short-read
    sequencing data, structural variation, and regional variant density profiling.

  <p class="muted">
    Overall, my interests lie at the intersection of applied plant breeding,
    comparative genomics, and data visualization, with the goal of translating
    genomic insights into practical tools and strategies for peanut improvement.
